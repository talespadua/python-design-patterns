# Design Patterns In Python

This repository contains the design patterns presented by the the book [Dive Into Design Patterns](https://refactoring.guru/design-patterns), by 
Alexander Shvets. 

I'm using this repo to study, and I'm mainly translating the pseudo-code into python code. I have also added 
tests, to provide insights on how to use those patterns and also how they benefit the testing of the code
 
Some patterns make less sense in languages with dynamic typing, and some of them can be written using 
specific features of the python language. Since I'm roughly translating the pseudocode to python code, 
some implementations can be overengineering.

There are implementations of all those patterns in Python and other languages in the Refactoring Guru website. 
I'm avoiding to check there before writing myself, but I strongly suggest you to check them out:
